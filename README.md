# 💊 OTC Pharmacy Sales Data Analysis

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of over-the-counter (OTC) medication sales in pharmacies. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the dataset using Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

The primary objective is to analyze sales data to identify:

- Best-selling products
- Countries with the highest sales volumes
- Top-performing salespeople
- Sales trends over time

---

## 🧰 Technologies and Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- IPython.display

## 📁 Project Structure

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**
   - Handling missing values
   - Type conversion and basic checks
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Unique products, country and product counts
   - Grouped statistics by product, country, and salesperson
3. **Data Visualization**
   - Bar charts, line plots, scatter plots
4. **Python Data Structures**
   - Use of lists, dictionaries, and tuples to handle and organize data
5. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Mean and standard deviation calculations using NumPy
6. **Final Insights and Summary**

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- **Top-Selling Product:** *Digestive Enzyme*
- **Country with Highest Total Sales:** *USA*
- **Top Salesperson:** *Nikhil Batra*, especially in the USA region
- A **strong positive correlation** is observed between the number of boxes shipped and the total sales amount
- The **monthly trend analysis** reveals seasonal patterns in sales

---

## ✅ Requirements Met

- Use of lists, dictionaries, and tuples
- Data filtering, grouping, and summarizing with pandas
- Column manipulation using pandas
- Mathematical operations with NumPy
- Data visualization (bar, line, scatter) with matplotlib
- Loops using `for`; (conditional structures can be extended)
- Comments and final report with insights (partially in Markdown)

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add conditional logic (`if/else`) and while loops to complete the Python structure requirements
- Enhance visualizations using Seaborn
- Introduce predictive analytics (e.g., regression models for forecasting)
- Segment analysis by product categories or time of year
